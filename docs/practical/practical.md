# Practical usage

Please read the AMANEQ user guide.
All the things written in the AMANEQ practical section are also important for CIRASAME.

## CDCE62002 initialization

Currently, the initialization of CDCE62002 at first power-on, is not required for CIRASAME since CDCE62002 is not used in the present firmware.
It may be required in the future upgrade.
